| Hari had pitched through an atrium opening from a roof, landing with a sickening thud. Blood cascaded down one side of his head and bones stuck out from a leg. When they arrived at the hospital, blue-pyjama’d workers (blue pyjamas - refers to the scrubs that healthcare workers wear) had wheeled out a gurney, tipped him expertly onto it and trundled (trundled - to wheel off) him off at an astonishing speed. <br><br>They had feared the worst, but Hari was discharged after two weeks, grinning his gap-toothed grin, with rows of stitches like tiny millipedes on his head and down his leg. Hari went home like a war veteran, and was coming out again next year. <br><br>By then he knew what they meant when they said, rich man country. <br><br>That was what you got in this place of good salary and orderly living. Things were always in place. For the sake of his sanity he must remember this, quell that desperate flapping in the pit of his stomach that was like the wings of a trapped bird. <br><br>But what was this rising panic? Pain was addling his judgement. There were surely worse places where such things could happen. Even at home. <br><br>Back home such an accident was terrifying on so many counts. Were there the facilities? Then, even if there were, could you afford it? Not everyone was insured. And finally, would you survive it? His friend Ashok had died from just such a fall. Unforeseen circumstances, said the hospital, and that had been that.<br><br>He grimaced. Fear was just your own imagination running wild. The horror stories were endless. Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Malaysia. Workers literally disappearing into thin air, lucky to be found or claimed, dead or alive, the nameless and faceless who slipped through the cracks. He felt his tension ebb. If he had to come to grief, at least he had come to grief in the right place. |

### Pg 115 to 116: Arul's wealth vs. the protagonist's poverty

|     |
| --- |
| He had known it then three years ago when Arul had come home with a new TV, a second-hand Vespa, and jewellery for his bride Adhita. Arul had left a farmer’s son, but in his absence had become a young man with prospects. Now, in the middle of his parents’ living room, before his Toshiba TV, Arul emanated (emanated - radiated/gave off)  a seigneurial (seigneurial - to act like a lord) air as he patted his old friend’s shoulder. It was a place where the salary was—Oof, Arul puffed out his cheeks and made an arc with his arms, encompassing the room, the TV, the newly tiled floor, the sounds of Adhita pounding chillies for dinner. He pursed his lips and nodded meaningfully, promise in his eyes: It can happen to you too. And as aromas wafted from the kitchen, the question hung between them: who would have thought that the likes of Arul, son of Ponniappan, rice farmer, could command the hand of a girl whose father owned a tyre shop in the big town? <br><br>Prospects, Arul murmured, self-importance in his tone. As though to underscore this, Adhita came in with freshly fried vadai and shyly placed it between them. Bridal coyness still hung about her. She had not yet acquired the authority of motherhood, but was clearly destined to. She would become a dignified matron, the mother of sons. And in an instant the question became a challenge between the two men.<br><br>They had played together as boys, caught meen flashing amongst the riverbed reeds, threshed rice side-by-side in fields whose yield barely covered the rent. But Arul’s father had sought a loan from an uncle who owned a supermarket in Kattukottai. And because of that loan, Arul would soon be building a whole house. And doubtless, that house was not far away.    |

| Despair filled him. His own family were all farmers living hand-to-mouth. The agency fees alone cost 93,000 rupees. His father did not bring home more than 1,000 rupees a month from which his mother fed them all and squirrelled away what she could for her daughters’ dowries. And there were no rich uncles in their family. What hope did he have?<br><br>...<br><br>Chief of this was that his name would be selected from the interminable lists of the many job agencies he had registered at. His Certificate in Technical Knowledge, obtained in six months from a small school in town, had decimated (decimated - destroyed) Ammu’s (Ammu - the protagonist’s mother) savings. His job-hunting afterward, living and sleeping in a space let by a spice seller, paying back in kind as his night watchman, had resulted in nothing. His weekends as goods packer and delivery man barely fed him. For a year he had lived this way. Then the spice shop closed down, and he was home again, forced back to the rice fields. Arul returned once more, but this time they did not speak of jobs, Arul’s burgeoning success a wall between them. Even Adhita had a Rolex now. |

| There at the bottom of Arul’s small garden they had lit cheroots beneath the guava tree. Smoke curled up and tangled itself in its branches. A friend of a friend asks if I know anyone. <br><br>A rush of warmth filled him. His old friend had not forgotten him. Money was now woefully short. Yet Arul himself, in the living and prosperous flesh, was proof of nothing ventured, nothing gained. Arul had a new house (proper cement, with running water and flushing toilets) and packed two cell phones, one with a Singapore line, another with the local line. In case boss needs to call me. He laid a hand on his friend’s shoulder. Fee repayment by deductions. Can call my friend. What do you think?<br><br>He stared at Arul, incredulous. What did he think? |

| __1st Paragraph: Describe the moment using 5W1H__         | One other moment where the unjust treatment is seen is when _(who)_ the protagonist _(where)_ was on the lorry. _(what)_ The protagonist is being transported on the lorry to have his body dumped following a severe head injury he sustained while working. His head injury is so sever that he lost control of bodily functions like his bladder, and he is worries that he will be scolded for damaging good on the lorry with his urine. _(how)_ This shows unjust treatment as the protagonist seems to be valued less than material good, and he is also not being treated in a way that is not morally right as he is not cared for as a human.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| __2nd Paragraph: PEALEAL using evidence from the moment__ | _(Point - explain how it is unjust)_ The moment demonstrates unjust treatment as the protagonist is being treated in a way that is not morally right, as he is not cared for. _(Evidence)_ This can be seen in how to lorry shook with "every __slam__ of the brakes" and how it "careened and plunged". _(Analysis)_ The diction "slam" creates a sense of a forceful action that forces the lorry to jerk violently to a stop. Moreover, to "careen" and to "plunge" shows how careless and reckless the lorry drivers are. The protagonist has a severe head injury, and the lorry drivers are not treating him with the care and conscientiousness we might expect them to treat someone who is so badly hurt. _(Link)_ This shows how little the protagonist's employers care about the protagonist's well-being _(Evidence)_ The violent movements of the lorry also lead to so much pain the protagonist "thought that his head would shatter". _(Analysis)_ The word "shatter" emphasises how the protagonist's pain was so agonising that he thought that his head would literally fall apart. _(Link)_ Despite the protagonist's severe injuries, we can see that his employers do not want to treat him with the care he need and instead are reckless and not worries about wether they would worsen his injuries. Hence, the way he is being treated is unjust. |

| __1st Paragraph: Describe the moment using 5W1H__         | One other moment in the story where characters are treated unjustly is seen in the protagonist’s reflection of how his friend, Ashok, and other foreign workers _(who)_ are neglected or go missing without their employers caring about their well-being _(what)_. This shows unjust treatment as the foreign workers’needs and well-being are neglected, and are treated like objects to be discarded _(how - link back to theme)_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| __2nd Paragraph: PEALEAL using evidence from the moment__ | _(point)_ This moment shows unjust treatment as workers are treated in a way that’s not morally right, as their well-being is neglected. _(evidence)_ This is seen in how when Ashok died under the hospital’s care, the hospital said it was due to “unforeseen circumstances”. _(anaylsis)_ The hospital’s response was vague with a dismissive tone, without giving details of their treatment or care for Ashok. (EVIDENCE) The line that “that had been that” _(anaylsis)_ creates a tone of finality, as though the hospital had refused to give more answers. This shows how the hospital showed a complete lack of care and responsibility for Ashok’s life, neglecting his well-being. _(link)_ He did not receive the treatment or care that he deserved, showing how he was treated in a way that was not morally right |
