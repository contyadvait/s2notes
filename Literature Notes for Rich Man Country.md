| Hari had pitched through an atrium opening from a roof, landing with a sickening thud. Blood cascaded down one side of his head and bones stuck out from a leg. When they arrived at the hospital, blue-pyjama’d workers (blue pyjamas - refers to the scrubs that healthcare workers wear) had wheeled out a gurney, tipped him expertly onto it and trundled (trundled - to wheel off) him off at an astonishing speed. <br><br>They had feared the worst, but Hari was discharged after two weeks, grinning his gap-toothed grin, with rows of stitches like tiny millipedes on his head and down his leg. Hari went home like a war veteran, and was coming out again next year. <br><br>By then he knew what they meant when they said, rich man country. <br><br>That was what you got in this place of good salary and orderly living. Things were always in place. For the sake of his sanity he must remember this, quell that desperate flapping in the pit of his stomach that was like the wings of a trapped bird. <br><br>But what was this rising panic? Pain was addling his judgement. There were surely worse places where such things could happen. Even at home. <br><br>Back home such an accident was terrifying on so many counts. Were there the facilities? Then, even if there were, could you afford it? Not everyone was insured. And finally, would you survive it? His friend Ashok had died from just such a fall. Unforeseen circumstances, said the hospital, and that had been that.<br><br>He grimaced. Fear was just your own imagination running wild. The horror stories were endless. Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Malaysia. Workers literally disappearing into thin air, lucky to be found or claimed, dead or alive, the nameless and faceless who slipped through the cracks. He felt his tension ebb. If he had to come to grief, at least he had come to grief in the right place. |

| Uneasy           | "<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">quell</mark> that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">desperate flapping in the pit of his stomach</mark> that was like <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the wings of a trapped bird</mark>"<br>• "Wings of a **trapped** bird" → The emphasis on the diction "trapped" highlights the inescapability of the situation, making the protagonist further seem uncertain about what's happening to him and his safety<br>• "Quell" → a diction which means to suppress a feeling. The protagonist is trying to calm down, but ultimately fails to do so, only managing to able to push the feeling away, leaving the fear unresolved. <br><br>"<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">But what was this rising pain?</mark> Pain was <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">addling</mark> to his judgement"<br>• "Rising panic" → shows that the uneasiness continues to increase despite his best efforts to remind himself he should be safe.<br>• "Pain was addling his judgement" → diction of the word "addled" heightens his sense of confusion, as he is unable to think clearly through the pain and uncertainty of the situation he is in.<br><br>"Were there the facilities<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">?</mark> Then, even if there were, could you afford it<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">?</mark> Not everyone was insured. Finally, would you survive it<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">?</mark>"<br>• Recalling the issues that foreign workers would commonly face when they are injured at the workplace<br>• Repeated questioning that creates a panicked, desperate tone, running through all the potential problems he might face. This creates a sense of ever increasing anxiety |
| Temporary Relief | "That was what you got in this place of good salary and orderly living. Things were always in place.”<br>• The use of short sentences creates a matter-of-fact tone, as though it is the truth.<br>• Use of the word "always" → Creates a sense of something definite, as though reassuring him he is guaranteed proper treatment for his injury.<br><br>"For the sake of sanity <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">he must remember this</mark>."<br>• "He must remember this" → Emphasis on the word "must" shows how he is reminding himself to remember that he is in Singapore, where he assumes he has access to proper healthcare. However, his relief is only temporary.<br><br>"He felt his tension <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ebb</mark>. If he had <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">come to grief</mark>, at least he had <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">come to grief in the right place</mark>"<br>• "ebb" → The diction "ebb" means to gradually decrease. His fear decreases, but not completely.<br>• While the protagonist feels safe in "the right place", the repetition of "come to grief" reminds us of the terrible situation and the hurt he is experiencing. The sense of safety and reassurance he gets from knowing that he is in Singapore is ultimately still tinged with a reminder of pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| He had known it then three years ago when Arul had come home with a new TV, a second-hand Vespa, and jewellery for his bride Adhita. Arul had left a farmer’s son, but in his absence had become a young man with prospects. Now, in the middle of his parents’ living room, before his Toshiba TV, Arul emanated (emanated - radiated/gave off)  a seigneurial (seigneurial - to act like a lord) air as he patted his old friend’s shoulder. It was a place where the salary was—Oof, Arul puffed out his cheeks and made an arc with his arms, encompassing the room, the TV, the newly tiled floor, the sounds of Adhita pounding chillies for dinner. He pursed his lips and nodded meaningfully, promise in his eyes: It can happen to you too. And as aromas wafted from the kitchen, the question hung between them: who would have thought that the likes of Arul, son of Ponniappan, rice farmer, could command the hand of a girl whose father owned a tyre shop in the big town? <br><br>Prospects, Arul murmured, self-importance in his tone. As though to underscore this, Adhita came in with freshly fried vadai and shyly placed it between them. Bridal coyness still hung about her. She had not yet acquired the authority of motherhood, but was clearly destined to. She would become a dignified matron, the mother of sons. And in an instant the question became a challenge between the two men.<br><br>They had played together as boys, caught meen flashing amongst the riverbed reeds, threshed rice side-by-side in fields whose yield barely covered the rent. But Arul’s father had sought a loan from an uncle who owned a supermarket in Kattukottai. And because of that loan, Arul would soon be building a whole house. And doubtless, that house was not far away.    |     |
