| Point       | The British tried to win support from the locals by addressing their housing challenges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Explanation | This means that much of the housing had been destroyed due to the war. Singapore's population was increasing due to a post-war baby boom. Many people were having to live in overcrowded conditions. This meant there was a large need for low-cost and affordable housing. To address this problem, the British created the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT). |
| Example     | For example, the SIT was formed in 1927 to provide for low-cost housing. From 1947 to 1959, the SIT managed to build 20,907 housing and shop units.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Link        | As a result, the British were able to provide the locals with low-cost housing. The locals would be able to see that the British cared about them and they would win some trust of the locals, allowing them to have more support.                                                                                                                              |

## Addressing Food Shortages

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Point       | Another way the British tried to win support from the locals was by addressing food shortages                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Explanation | This is because there was a lack of food during and after the war in Singapore due to trade with neighbouring countries being disrupted and agricultural land being devastated. The locals faced malnutrition and war-time rationing had to continue even after the war. |
| Example     | To address this, the British set up People's restaurants to help provide affordable food for the locals and set up 10 People's restaurants by 1946.                                                                                                                      |
| Link        | As a result, people could obtain cheap quality meal from such restaurants, reducing their unhappiness with the British. The locals would see that the British were able to provide and care for them, thus increasing the support for the British.                       |
