### Laws and Policies

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State       | One way to sustainably manage transport is by having laws on policies on transport.                                                                                                                  |
| Definition  | This means to raise awareness and educate all road users on practicing good road safety habits to encourage use of alternatives such as public transport and other forms of active mobility.         |
| Explanation | When there are such policies, sustainable transport is achieved because drivers will be more educated with the rules and regulations of road safety preventing mishaps and accidents on major roads. |
| Example     | For example, Singapore implements Silver Zones in certain areas of the country so as to allow senior citizens to be safe when crossing roads and also to indicate to drivers to slow down.           |
| Link        | Hence, one way to sustainable manage transport is by having laws and policies on transport.                                                                                                          |

### Integrated Transport

|             |                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State       | Another way to sustainably manage transport is by having integrated transport.                                                                    |
| Definition  | This refers to having a number of transport types being located together                                                                          |
| Explanation | When there is integrated transport, transport sustainably can be achieved because people can easily access transport and move across the country. |
| Example     | For example, there is both a bus interchange, taxi stand and MRT station at Bedok Interchange.                                                    |
| Link        | Hence, one way to sustainably manage transport is by having laws and policies on transport.                                                       |

### Research and Development

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| State       | Another way to sustainably manage transport is through research and development.                                                                                                                 |
| Definition  | This refers to improving mobility as well as having safer and more environmentally friendly transport options.                                                                                   |
| Explanation | When research and development is done and implemented, transport systems can be sustainably managed as this can help manage to ever changing environment and cope with challenges they may face. |
| Example     | For example, electric vehicles help make transport more sustainable as it has a lower carbon footprint then normal fuel-powered vehicles.                                                        |
| Link        | Hence, research and development is one way to manage transport sustainably.                                                                                                                      |

### Provision of a range of mobility options

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| State       | The last way to manage transport sustainably is through the provision of a range of mobility options for different groups of people                                                                                      |
| Definition  | This refers to ensuring that diverse transportation options are available to meet the varying needs of people                                                                                                            |
| Explanation | When there is a range of mobility options, transport systems in Singapore can be sustainably managed as it helps provide help to different types of people to manage their daily tasks without any additional obstacles. |
| Example     | For example, the Green Man+ scheme was implemented to give elderly pedestrians up to 13 seconds more green man time when crossing the road so they have more time to cross the road.                                     |
| Link        | Hence, the provision of a range of mobility options for different groups of people is one way to manage transport sustainably                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
