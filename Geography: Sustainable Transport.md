|              |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| State        | One way to susstainably manage transport is by having laws on policies on transport.                                                                                                                    |
| Definition   | This means to raise awareness and eduace all road users on practicing good road safety habits to encourage use of alternatives such as public transport and other forms of active mobility.             |
| Explaination | When there are such policies, sustainable transport is achieved because drivers will be more educated with the rules and regulatations of road safety preventing mishaps and accidents on major roads.  |
| Example      | For example, Singapore implements Silver Zones in certain areas of the contury so as to allow senior citizens to be safe when crossing roads and also to indicate to drivers to slow down.              |

## Integrated Transport

|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| State        | One way to susstainably manage transport is by having integrated transport.                                                                          |
| Definition   | This refers to having a number of transport types being located together                                                                             |
| Explaination | When there is integrated transport transport, sustainably can be achieved because people can easily access the transport and move across the contry. |
| Example      | For example, there is both a bus interchange, taxi stand and MRT station at Bedok Interchange.                                                       |
